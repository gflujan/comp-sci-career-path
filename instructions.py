You'll be asked a series of questions (15 to be exact) that will get harder as you go along.
Each question will have 4 possible answers but only one of them will be right.

If you correctly answer a question, you'll add that amount of prize money to your total winnings.
At any point in the game, you can walk away with your current winnings by simply typing "walk".

This version of the game gives you three strikes. You can attempt to re-answer the same question to try and advance.
However, if you get 3 strikes and haven't correctly answered or haven't taken your money, you'll lose whatever you've earned.

If you're familiar with (or expecting) lifelines in this game, TOO BAD!!! They'll be added later... maybe. ;-)

Okay, that's pretty much it. If you have any questions, um, try Google. :-)

Alright, let's play "Who Wants to be a Millionaire"!!!
